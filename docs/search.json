In this capacity, he leads a team of 28 research assistants and numerous collaborators, fostering a collaborative and enriching research environment.\nDuring PhD, he received training in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, with a primary emphasis on memory suppression and utilising brainwave (EEG/ERP) data to examine possession of criminal knowledge. Additionally, his research encompasses contemplative neuroscience, where I aim to explore neural correlates of contemplative practices.\nHe uses experimental (behavioural as well as neuroscientific) and observational research methods.\nSince the end of 2022, he have been using GitHub with RStudio and Quarto to learn, produce, and share code. Occasionally, he uses Matlab and Python too.\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Why we need ethics approval?\nEthical approval for research is essential to ensure that studies involving human participants are conducted in a morally responsible and respectful manner. It serves to protect the rights, wellbeing, dignity, and confidentiality of those involved in the research, as well as the broader community affected by the study. Ethical approval ensures that potential risks are minimized, benefits are maximized, informed consent is obtained, and any potential conflicts of interest or biases are addressed. This oversight helps maintain public trust in the scientific community and upholds the fundamental principles of fairness, respect, and accountability in research endeavors."

Beside research, I teach psychology at University of Canterbury. I migrated to New Zealand in 2011 and have been living in Christchurch since.

This inspired me to develop a booster study to enhance Muslim representation in the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, since we are underrepresented at present. This limits the inferences we can make about how Muslims diversity, perception, flourishing, resilience, and meaning-making.\n\n\n\n\nWe are recruiting Muslim collaborators and Muslim research assistants from the community - which will not only help us work together with Muslim scholars, but also train a new cohort of Muslim researchers who might lead further Muslim-focused research, and help bring Muslims of New Zealand closer to science. This is what excites me, and this is why this project is so close to my heart.\n\n\n\nMore about me: Academic website, Institution Homepage"

For a description of our safety protocols click here.\nParticipation: the NZAVS is committed to enhancing the research capacity of our communities in Aotearoa New Zealand. Any NZAVS research focusing specifically on the Muslim community will be reviewed by our Muslim academic advisor Dr Usman Afzali, and/or appropriate nominated reviewers from the Muslim community in New Zealand. We are committed to Muslim community-led research for Muslim-focussed studies to ensure respectful reporting that considers the social, religious, and cultural settings of New Zealand’s Muslims.\nPartnership: the NZAVS actively fosters opportunities for collaborative research with emerging Muslim researchers in New Zealand. We seek to mentor Muslim graduate students interested in accessing NZAVS data for research in their own postgraduate theses or dissertations. We invite students from the Muslim community in New Zealand to contact our Muslim academic advisor, or any member of the NZAVS board or leadership team for guidance in developing a project.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
